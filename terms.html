      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective Date: October 1, 2025</p>
      <p>Welcome to Shumba Creations & Logistics. By using our services, you agree to the following Terms & Conditions. Please read carefully before engaging our services.</p>

      <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>Shumba Creations & Logistics (“we,” “our,” or “us”) offers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sourcing & Procurement:</strong> Supplier search, negotiation, and inspection in China.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics & Freight Coordination:</strong> Arranging shipping, customs documentation, and delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Services:</strong> Website, poster, and document design as listed in our Price List.</li>
        <li><strong>Document Services:</strong> Editing, translations, and PDF optimization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We act as a facilitator between clients and suppliers/shipping companies. We do not manufacture goods ourselves.</p>

      <h2>2. Pricing & Payment</h2>
      <p>Prices are listed on our website and subject to change without prior notice. A 10% service fee applies to sourcing, procurement, and logistics services. Payments must be made in full before work begins unless otherwise agreed in writing. We accept bank transfer, PayPal (where available), and other agreed methods.</p>

      <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and complete shipment or design requirements.</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with local import/export laws in your country.</li>
        <li>Pay all duties, customs charges, and taxes applicable in the destination country.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Shipping & Logistics</h2>
      <p>We coordinate with trusted freight partners but cannot guarantee delivery times due to customs, carrier delays, or force majeure events. Title and risk of goods transfer to the client once handed over to the shipping company. Insurance is available upon request and at the client’s cost.</p>

      <h2>5. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>Design Services: Refunds are only available before work has started. Once drafts are delivered, payments are non-refundable. Logistics/Sourcing: Service fees are non-refundable once supplier engagement or freight booking has started. If a shipment is canceled by the client after booking, cancellation charges may apply.</p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All original designs (websites, posters, documents) remain our property until full payment is received. After full payment, ownership transfers to the client for personal or business use. We reserve the right to showcase completed design work in our portfolio.</p>

      <h2>7. Liability Limitations</h2>
      <p>We are not liable for delays caused by customs, carriers, or force majeure. Quality issues arising from third-party suppliers are not our responsibility unless inspection services were explicitly purchased. Our liability for losses is limited to the value of the services paid to us.</p>

      <h2>8. Communication</h2>
      <p>Our primary communication channels are email and WhatsApp. Typical response time: within one business day. For urgent requests, WhatsApp is recommended.</p>

      <h2>9. Privacy & Data</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide services (name, email, shipment details). Your data will never be sold or shared with unauthorized third parties. By using our services, you consent to communications via email and WhatsApp.</p>

      <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of China. Any disputes will be resolved under the jurisdiction of Chinese courts, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

      <h2>11. Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms & Conditions at any time. The latest version will always be available on our website.</p>

      <p class="muted"><strong>By requesting a quote, booking a service, or making payment, you confirm that you have read and agreed to these Terms & Conditions.</strong></p>
