      <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective Date: October 1, 2025</p>

      <p>At Shumba Creations & Logistics, we value transparency. This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines how cancellations and refunds are handled for our services.</p>

      <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
      <p>All service requests are confirmed only after full or agreed payment has been received.</p>
      <p>Our 10% service fee for sourcing and logistics is non-refundable once work has started.</p>
      <p>Refunds, where applicable, will be processed to the original payment method within 7–14 business days.</p>

      <h2>2. Design Services (Websites, Posters, Documents)</h2>
      <p>Before work begins: Full refund is available if cancellation is requested before design work has started.</p>
      <p>After drafts/deliverables are shared: Payments become non-refundable, as work has already been performed.</p>
      <p>Revisions: Minor revisions are included as stated in the plan. Additional revisions may incur extra charges.</p>

      <h2>3. Sourcing & Procurement Services</h2>
      <p>Once we have engaged suppliers, negotiated, or arranged inspections, service fees are non-refundable.</p>
      <p>If a client cancels before supplier contact has been made, a partial refund (minus administrative charges) may be available.</p>

      <h2>4. Logistics & Freight Services</h2>
      <p>Freight bookings are subject to carrier and port rules.</p>
      <p>If canceled by client: Any cancellation fees charged by carriers will be deducted from the refund.</p>
      <p>If canceled by carrier or due to force majeure: We will assist in rebooking, but refunds are subject to the carrier’s policy.</p>

      <h2>5. Document & Translation Services</h2>
      <p>Before work begins: Full refund available.</p>
      <p>After work has started or been delivered: No refunds.</p>

      <h2>6. Exceptions</h2>
      <p>No refunds will be provided in cases where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The client provides incorrect or incomplete shipment/document details.</li>
        <li>Customs clearance is denied due to client’s non-compliance.</li>
        <li>Delays are caused by carriers, customs, or force majeure events.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Contact for Refund Requests</h2>
      <p>All refund or cancellation requests must be submitted in writing to: <strong>shumbacreations@outlook.com</strong> or via WhatsApp at <strong>+8613779964069</strong>.</p>
